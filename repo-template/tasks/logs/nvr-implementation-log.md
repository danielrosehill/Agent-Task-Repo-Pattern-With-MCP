# NVR Implementation Progress Log

**Task**: Install and configure NVR system on Ubuntu VM  
**Start Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Agent**: AI Assistant  
**Status**: In Progress

## Session 1 - Initial Setup (2024-01-15 09:00)

### Actions Taken
- Connected to remote server at 10.0.0.4 via SSH using mcp-ssh
- Verified Ubuntu 22.04 LTS installation
- Updated system packages: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
- Installed Docker and Docker Compose

### Findings
- Server has adequate resources: 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores
- Network connectivity to all 4 camera feeds confirmed
- Port 80 and 443 available for web interface

### Issues Encountered
- None in this session

### Next Steps
- Research NVR software options (Frigate, MotionEye, Shinobi)
- Test RTSP feed connectivity from server

---

## Session 2 - Software Selection (2024-01-15 14:30)

### Actions Taken
- Researched open-source NVR solutions
- Selected Frigate for its modern architecture and AI features
- Created docker-compose.yml configuration
- Tested RTSP connectivity to all 4 cameras

### Findings
- All RTSP feeds accessible from server
- Frigate supports the required features (grid view, individual feeds, status monitoring)
- Hardware acceleration available via CPU

### Issues Encountered
- Camera 3 (rtsp://cam3) intermittent connectivity - noted for fault tolerance implementation

### Next Steps
- Deploy Frigate container
- Configure camera feeds
- Implement web interface customizations

---

## Session 3 - Deployment (2024-01-15 16:45)

### Actions Taken
- Deployed Frigate using Docker Compose
- Configured all 4 camera feeds in frigate.yml
- Implemented basic web interface
- Added tally light indicators using CSS overlays

### Findings
- Frigate successfully ingesting 3/4 camera feeds
- Web interface responsive and functional
- Tally light logic working as specified

### Issues Encountered
- Camera 3 still showing intermittent connectivity
- Need to implement fault-tolerant display (hide offline cameras)

### Solutions Implemented
- Added JavaScript to hide cameras offline >45 seconds
- Implemented orange/red tally states based on last frame timing

### Next Steps
- Test reverse proxy configuration
- Validate external accessibility
- Final testing with Daniel

---

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Camera 3 may need hardware troubleshooting
- Consider adding recording functionality if requested
- Monitor system resources under full load
